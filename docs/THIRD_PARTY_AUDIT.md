# Third-Party Audit

This audit documents the v0.1.1 repository state after cleanup.

| Project / file / dependency | Source | Current use | License status | Risk | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bridge/src/vibe_stick/` | Project-authored Python | Local Mac bridge, state API, quota observation, recording flow, ASR adapter, paste injection | MIT under this repository | Low | Keep. |
| `app/macos/VibeStickHUD/main.swift` | Project-authored Swift | Minimal recording status HUD | MIT under this repository | Low | Keep. |
| `firmware/sticks3/src/` and `firmware/sticks3/include/` | Project-authored C using ESP-IDF APIs | StickS3 UI, HTTP, buttons, audio, battery, speaker alerts | MIT under this repository | Low | Keep. |
| `assets/brand/vibestick-icon.svg` | Project-generated simple geometry | Temporary VibeStick brand icon | MIT under this repository | Low | Keep until polished branding exists. |
| `assets/providers/**` and `firmware/sticks3/assets/providers/**` | Project-generated simple geometry | Temporary provider/status icons | MIT under this repository | Low | Keep. Avoid replacing with third-party brand marks unless license/brand usage is reviewed. |
| `firmware/sticks3/generated/vibe_stick_ui_assets.c/.h` | Generated from project-owned PNG icons | LVGL image descriptors for provider icons | MIT under this repository | Low | Keep. |
| `firmware/sticks3/generated/vibe_stick_cn_16.c` | Generated from Noto Sans SC Regular | LVGL Chinese glyph subset for StickS3 UI | Source font is SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Medium | Keep with NOTICE attribution. Do not use the reserved font name as a VibeStick brand. |
| `firmware/sticks3/src/idf_component.yml` dependencies: `espressif/button`, `espressif/esp_codec_dev`, `lvgl/lvgl` | ESP Component Registry | Build-time firmware dependencies | External open-source components, not vendored after cleanup | Low | Keep dependency manifest and lock file. Review component licenses before binary release. |
| ESP-IDF framework | Espressif | Firmware framework | External SDK, not vendored | Low | Keep as build prerequisite. |
| Groq ASR API | Optional external service | Optional speech-to-text when configured | Service API, no source vendored | Medium | Document that audio leaves the Mac when Groq is configured. Do not commit API keys. |
| Local Codex session files | User-local Codex data | Quota/status observation from `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` | User-local data, not vendored | Medium | Keep local-only. Do not upload or commit session data. |
| Historical VoiceStick / StickS3VoiceKit / VoiceStickTrial directories outside this repository | Local historical reference directories in the parent workspace | Not part of VibeStick repository | Source/license uncertain from local copy | High | Do not copy into VibeStick. Do not publish as part of this repository. |
| Old provider logo-like assets removed during cleanup | Earlier local prototype assets | No longer used | Source unclear / brand risk | High | Replaced with simple project-generated temporary icons. |
| `firmware/sticks3/managed_components/`, `firmware/sticks3/build/`, Python `__pycache__/` | Generated local build/cache output | Not part of source | N/A | Low | Ignored by git. Do not commit. |
| `firmware/sticks3/include/vibe_stick_secrets.h`, `.env`, logs, recordings | Local user secrets/output | Runtime configuration and generated data | Private user data | High | Ignored by git. Never publish. |

## Summary

No third-party source code or brand assets are intentionally vendored in this repository after cleanup, except the generated Chinese LVGL glyph subset derived from Noto Sans SC under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. Build-time firmware dependencies are resolved through the ESP-IDF component manager and are not committed as vendored source.

Before a public binary release, review the exact ESP-IDF/component licenses included in the firmware image and ensure the Noto Sans SC attribution remains in NOTICE.
