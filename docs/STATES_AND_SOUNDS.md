# States And Sounds

VibeStick v0.2.0 plays sounds only for key agent status changes on the home screen. Recording states do not play sounds.

| State | Trigger | Sound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Completed / 完成 | Codex reports `DONE`, `COMPLETED`, or `SUCCESS` | 880 Hz 80 ms, 40 ms gap, 1320 Hz 120 ms |
| Error / 报错 | Codex reports `ERROR`, `FAILED`, or `FAILURE` | 240 Hz 100 ms, 60 ms gap, repeated 3 times |
| Waiting for approval / 等待审批 | Codex reports `APPROVAL`, `WAITING_APPROVAL`, `PENDING_APPROVAL`, or `NEEDS_APPROVAL` | 600 Hz 100 ms, 60 ms gap, 800 Hz 100 ms |

## Implementation

Sound generation lives in `firmware/sticks3/src/vibe_audio.c`.

The firmware generates 16 kHz mono 16-bit PCM in memory and plays it through the ES8311 / I2S speaker path. No WAV, MP3, TTS, or network service is used for agent alert sounds.

Recording has priority. If recording is active, alert sounds are skipped instead of queued.

Duplicate prevention lives in `firmware/sticks3/src/main.c`. A sound is played only once for a new `alert.event_id`; if no event id exists, the firmware falls back to status-edge detection.
