# Contributing to VibeStick

Thanks for your interest! VibeStick is an early-preview project — bug reports, ideas, and
pull requests are welcome.

## Project layout
- `firmware/sticks3/` — ESP32-S3 firmware (C, ESP-IDF v5.5.x)
- `bridge/` — local macOS bridge service (Python, standard library only)
- `app/macos/` — minimal HUD (Swift)
- `scripts/`, `docs/`

## Dev setup & checks
Bridge (Python 3.11+):
    python3 -m compileall -q bridge/src tests
    PYTHONPATH=bridge/src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
Firmware: install ESP-IDF v5.5.x (see README), then `cd firmware/sticks3 && idf.py build`.
CI runs the bridge checks on every push / PR.

## Guidelines
- No third-party Python dependencies — the bridge uses only the standard library; keep it that way.
- Never commit secrets — keep keys/tokens/Wi-Fi creds in the gitignored `.env` and
  `vibe_stick_secrets.h`; don't log tokens or raw API responses.
- Match the surrounding code style; add/update tests for behavior changes.
- Don't change provider icons / generated assets without discussion.

## Pre-push privacy check
Treat every commit as if it will be public. Before pushing, review the working
tree, staged diff, and every untracked file. Check for secrets and personal data,
including tokens, credentials, private email addresses, local paths, device
identifiers, recordings, transcripts, logs, screenshots, and raw service
responses. Avoid `git add .` until every untracked file has been reviewed.

Keep `.env`, secret headers, `sdkconfig*`, recordings, state files, logs, and
build outputs untracked. Contributors should use a GitHub `noreply` email when
they do not want a personal email address exposed in commit metadata.

## Pull requests
1. Fork and create a branch. 2. Make focused commits with clear messages.
3. Ensure the checks above pass. 4. Open a PR describing what changed and why.

## Issues
- Bugs / features: open a GitHub issue.
- Security: see SECURITY.md — report privately.
